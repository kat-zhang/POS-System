# Webster-Halsted POS

This app is designed to be a restaurant POS system. The app was developed to improve upon some of the "pain points" that restaurants typically have with their POS systems. 

The Webster Halsted POS system combines a consumer-view and a restaurant-view. 

In the consumer-view, customers can browse from a collection restaurants (establishments that use the service are to be available) and make a reservation online. 

The restaurant-view is password protected and was created specifically for the front of house restaurant staff. This view has 3 different access levels: manager, host and server. 

The server is able to change the table status, enter the tables order, get the check for the customer and even split the bill if the party desires to have split checks. The host and manager are able to view upcoming reservations and assign servers to tables. 

Staff are able to view upcoming reservations and update table status on the floorplan by tapping on the table icons. 
Servers are able to enter orders by table number and even split checks if desired. 

**To access the restaurant view, use the following username/password combination - admin@shine.com/password**
